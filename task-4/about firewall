### Windows Firewall
- **Overview**: Built-in security feature in Windows OS to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Inbound/Outbound Rules**: Filters traffic to/from specific ports, protocols, or applications.
  - **Windows Defender Firewall**: Integrated with Windows Security; supports basic and advanced configurations.
  - **Modes**: Can block or allow connections; supports profiles (Domain, Private, Public) for different network types.
  - **Configuration**: Managed via Control Panel, PowerShell, or Group Policy for enterprise settings.
  - **Logging**: Tracks allowed/blocked connections for troubleshooting.
  - **Use Case**: Protects against unauthorized access, malware, and network-based attacks.
  - **Limitations**: Basic compared to enterprise-grade firewalls; may require third-party tools for advanced features.

### Linux Firewall
- **Overview**: Linux uses tools like **iptables**, **nftables**, or **firewalld** to manage network traffic and secure systems.
- **Key Tools**:
  - **iptables**: Traditional tool for setting rules to filter traffic based on source, destination, ports, and protocols.
  - **nftables**: Modern replacement for iptables; more efficient, supports complex rulesets.
  - **firewalld**: Dynamic, user-friendly firewall management with zones (e.g., trusted, public) for different network environments.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Granular Control**: Rules based on IP, port, protocol, or interface.
  - **Zones**: Assigns rules to specific network interfaces (e.g., home, public).
  - **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks connection states (e.g., NEW, ESTABLISHED) for better security.
  - **Configuration**: Managed via CLI (iptables/nftables) or GUI (firewalld).
  - **Logging**: Logs traffic for analysis using tools like **journalctl** or custom logs.
- **Use Case**: Secures servers, desktops, and containers; widely used in enterprise and cloud environments.
- **Limitations**: Steeper learning curve for iptables/nftables; requires manual configuration for complex setups.
